# APPLICANT SELECTOR

This application is developed to automatize the filtering of applicants into Big Data Analytics Program.

The relevant scripts are: 

- drive_to_gcs.py : script to move list pdfs to gcs
- pdf_to_json.py : script to get text from pdfs
- update_json_in_db.py : script to save texts into applicants.db
- get_excel.py : script to generate predictive model to filter applicants.

These scripts were run but there are changes that need to be done to be replicated in other environments.
